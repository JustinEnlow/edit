always ensure:
    any input from the user results in some visual response being displayed. never should a user action result in no change...
    user should be able to negate this by removing code that triggers warning mode in each action fn called, or a config flag

follow documentation style from https://std-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/development/how-to-write-documentation.html

create tests for all functionality
    if the body of a test is not implemented yet, add todo!() in the test body, and #[ignore] ahead of the function name
        "cargo test"                                    //run only non ignored tests
        "cargo test -- --include-ignored"               //run all tests, including ignored
        "cargo test -- --ignored"                       //run only ignored tests
    or add #[cfg(feature = "unfinished-tests")] before the unimplemented test
        "cargo test --no-default-features"              //won't compile tests with that feature
        "cargo test --features unfinished-tests"        //includes them
create tests for all todo functionality or known bugs   //trying to get away from using the todo.rs file...
the test name should be an explanation of the desired functionality or the bug



use "cargo clippy" to run lints
use "cargo clippy -- -W clippy::pedantic" to run pedantic lints
//some specific lints are ignored in lib.rs due to personal taste/preference



use "cargo doc --open" to view the documentation


how to debug:   //this was taken from 'edit_core'. may not reflect actual use with 'edit'
type:
    "rust-gdb ./target/debug/deps/edit_core-ee4" then 'tab' to complete the hash
inside gdb
    "break <module-name>::<sub-module-name>::tests::<full-unit-test-name>"
    "run <module-name>::<sub-module-name>::tests::<full-unit-test-name>"
then hit <ctrl-x> then a, to enter tui mode with test source        or type "layout src", apparently
hit <ctrl-l> to repaint screen, if ncurses prints some funky shit in the tui
and <ctrl-p> to redo a command in the history, since the tui source code window hijacks the <up> arrow

TODO

[ ] render selections
[ ] impl undo/redo
[ ] colorize syntax/etc.
[ ] display completion suggestions
[ ] fix when scroll view right is held, it keeps scrolling after release, making editor unresponsive until it finishes scroll
    - this seems to be resolved in release builds...


always ensure:
    any input from the user should result in some visual response being displayed. never should a user action result in no change...
